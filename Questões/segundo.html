      The black hole Of the Window Where you sleep The night breeze Carries
      Something sweet A peach tree Wild women don't get the blues But I find
      that Lately I've been crying like a Tall child So please hurry leave me I
      can't breathe Please don't say you love me 胸がはち切れそうで One word
      from you and I would Jump off of this Ledge I'm on Baby Tell me "don't" So
      I can Crawl back in And I was so young When I behaved Twenty five Yet now
      I find I've grown into A tall child And I don't wanna go home yet Let me
      walk to the top of the big night sky Please hurry leave me I can't breathe
      Please don't say you love me 胸がはち切れそうで One word from you and I
      would Jump off of this Ledge I'm on Baby Tell me "don't" So I can Crawl
      back in One word from you and I would Jump off of this Ledge I'm on Baby
      Tell me "don't" So I can Crawl back in

    <div class="green-div">
      I will retire to the Salton Sea At the age of 23 For I'm starting to learn
      I may never be free But though I may never be free Fuck you and your money
      I'm tired of your money And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest
      night With no one else in sight You know I wore this dress for you These
      killer heels for you See the dark, it moves With every breath of the
      breeze
